# Introduction

ACE is a software package designed to quickly and accurately infer Ising or Potts models based on correlation data from a variety of biological and artificial systems.

Given a set of correlation data or sequence input in [FASTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format, ACE will produce a Ising or Potts model that reproduces the input correlations to within the expected error due to finite sampling.


# Installation

Download the package and run:

```r
./configure
make
make install
```
