# Introduction

ACE is a software package designed to quickly and accurately infer [Ising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model) or [Potts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potts_model) models based on correlation data from a variety of biological and artificial systems.

Given a set of correlation data or sequence input in [FASTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format, ACE will produce a Ising or Potts model that reproduces the input correlations to within the expected error due to finite sampling.


# Installation

Download and unzip the package, then run the following commands in the terminal from the new directory:

```r
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```
